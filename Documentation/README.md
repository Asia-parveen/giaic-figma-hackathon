üéâ Marketplace Technical Foundation Day 2 Task Completed! üöÄ

I have successfully completed the Day 2 task of the Marketplace Technical Foundation.
This task involved building the frontend using Next.js and the backend with Sanity CMS, 
along with seamlessly integrating third-party APIs to create an efficient and dynamic e-commerce website.

Highlights:

üõ†Ô∏è Frontend: Developed with Next.js for fast and interactive UI/UX.
üì¶ Backend: Integrated Sanity CMS for robust content management.
üåê API Integration: Connected all necessary links to third-party APIs to ensure functionality and data flow.
üõí E-commerce Features: Implemented core features for a smooth and responsive shopping experience.
This project was a fantastic opportunity to enhance my skills in modern web development technologies while focusing on creating a scalable and efficient marketplace solution.

Looking forward to more challenges and learning opportunities ahead! üòä

üéâ Marketplace Technical Foundation Day 4 Task Completed! üöÄ

Day 4 Task: E-commerce Website Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity CMS
Description:
In this task, I have developed a fully functional E-commerce Website using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Sanity CMS. The website is designed to provide an interactive user experience with a dynamic product listing and detailed product pages.make many reuseable componenets.

Key Features:
Next.js with TypeScript:

The website is built using Next.js, a React framework, for seamless server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). The application is structured with TypeScript to enhance the development process with type safety.
Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling, ensuring a highly customizable and responsive design for the e-commerce platform.
Sanity CMS:

Sanity CMS is integrated for content management, allowing easy management of product data. It is used to fetch product information dynamically, such as images, prices, and details, from a headless CMS.
Dynamic Routing:

I have implemented dynamic routing for product pages. Each product is displayed dynamically based on its unique ID, enabling a clean and scalable URL structure.
Reusable Components:

The website includes several reusable components, including a product card, product detail page, and product list. This modular approach ensures that the website is maintainable and easy to extend in the future.
Responsive Design:

The website is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) to ensure a consistent and smooth user experience across all devices.
Tasks Completed:
Product Listing Page: A dynamic product listing page that fetches data from Sanity CMS and displays products with their images, names, and prices.
Product Detail Page: Each product has its own dedicated page showing detailed information, including product images, description, and price.
Reusable Components: Components like product cards, buttons, and layouts are reusable, making the site easy to maintain and expand.

# E-Commerce Website with Next.js and Sanity CMS

This project is an e-commerce platform built during Day 5 of a hackathon. The application is designed using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Sanity CMS** for content management. The platform includes a range of features like product fetching, dynamic cart management, error handling, and optimized loading states.

---

## Features

### 1. **Dynamic Product Management**
- Products are fetched dynamically from **Sanity CMS**.
- Real-time updates in the CMS reflect directly on the website.

### 2. **API Integration**
- APIs are used to fetch product data from Sanity CMS.
- Handled scenarios like network issues or missing product data gracefully with error messages and fallback content.

### 3. **Cart Management**
- Add, remove, and update products in the cart.
- Persistent cart data using browser storage (local storage or session storage).
- Validation for product quantities to ensure accurate cart updates.

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Implemented user-friendly error messages for:
  - **Product Not Found**: Displayed when a product is missing from the database.
  - **API Errors**: Clear feedback to users when API calls fail due to network issues.
  - **Cart Management Errors**: Prevent invalid operations like adding out-of-stock products.

### 5. **Loading States**
- Skeleton loaders and spinners for a smooth user experience while fetching data.
- Different loading indicators for:
  - Product pages.
  - Cart operations.
  - API interactions.

## Technologies Used

### **Frontend**
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React-based framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

### **Content Management**
- [Sanity CMS](https://www.sanity.io/): Headless CMS for managing and delivering content.

### **State Management**
- Context API for managing global state (e.g., cart data).
- Local storage for cart persistence.
 Challenges and Solutions
 (use many other labriers)

### 1. **API Network Issues**
   - **Problem**: Delays or failures in fetching data from the CMS.
   - **Solution**:
     - Implemented retry logic for API calls.
     - Displayed fallback content when the API fails.
     - Logged errors for easier debugging.

### 2. **Product Not Found**
   - **Problem**: Missing or deleted products in Sanity CMS.
   - **Solution**:
     - Added conditional rendering to display an error message if a product is not found.
     - Redirected users to a fallback page for a better experience.

### 3. **Cart Management Errors**
   - **Problem**: Issues like adding unavailable products or invalid cart updates.
   - **Solution**:
     - Validated product availability before adding to the cart.
     - Added alerts for operations like exceeding stock limits.

### 4. **Loading State Management**
   - **Problem**: Lack of visual feedback during API calls caused confusion.
   - **Solution**:
     - Integrated skeleton loaders for product pages.
     - Used spinners and disabled buttons during cart operations.
